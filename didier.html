            <div>
                <p>According to the article from Café de la Bourse, cryptocurrency is a virtual currency characterized by the lack of physical form, meaning it has no coins or banknotes, and payments by checks or bank cards are impossible.
                    <br><br>
                    It also allows the purchase of goods and services. Cryptocurrencies are increasingly used in legal transactions. They are also a series of numbers stored on a computer in the form of blockchains. This principle is called blockchain. The main cryptocurrency is Bitcoin.</p>

                <p>These virtual currencies are gaining more and more importance and allow other economic actors to benefit from them. Indeed, Facebook has planned a project with a new private currency called Libra. However, this currency is strongly criticized.
                    <br>
                    Indeed, according to the article in Le Monde, the G7 is only in favor of establishing Libra within a legal framework. In fact, Bruno Le Maire, who is the Minister of Economy of France, together with Italy and Germany, is planning a series of measures to try to ban the development and sale of Libra in Europe.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, despite being criticized for the risks they pose, cryptocurrencies represent a kind of evolution of the economy towards a much more digital economy.
                    <br><br>
                    In fact, according to an article from the website The Coin Tribune, with the Easy Wallet application created by the company Global P.O.S (a specialist in digital payments) and its partners, several French retailers such as Boulanger, Décathlon, or Conforama would be able to accept payments in virtual currency. This demonstrates the increasing democratization of cryptocurrencies.</p>
