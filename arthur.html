            <div>
                <p>Lately, we have been hearing a lot about new cryptocurrencies like Libra or even China's state
                    cryptocurrency, although they are not yet in the cryptocurrency market.
                    <br><br>
                    Cryptocurrency is a virtual currency that uses blockchain technology and is issued peer-to-peer,
                    which means there is no need for a bank intermediary. Money is transferred directly from one
                    individual to another or to a business. With cryptocurrency, exchanges are anonymous, secure, thanks to encryption, and facilitate online transactions.</p>

                <p>With the advent of cryptocurrencies, many stakeholders are debating the fate and future of
                    cryptocurrency, such as Europe wanting to counter Facebook's virtual currency project. "We do not want digital giants to further extend their influence into new areas. We do not see what legitimizes the entry of digital giants into a field of competence that belongs to the States - that is to say, money." (Bruno Le Maire, Le Figaro).
                    <br>
                    The EU does not want the GAFA to have a cryptocurrency because cryptocurrency seems to be a
                    threat to central banks. "Nearly one-third (29%) of central banks believe that digital currencies pose risks to financial stability" (Les Echos), as the value of the state's currency will decrease due to debt because the population is withdrawing their money from banks.
                    <br><br>
                    China wants to "reconcile blockchain technology with state control" (Le Figaro), even though "The creators of Bitcoin dreamed of a currency freed from the control of states" (Le Figaro), while Germany wishes for the issuance of digital currencies to be carried out by the state and not by private companies (Les Ã‰chos).
                    <br><br>
                    In the end, the arrival of new cryptocurrencies can be either a good thing or the complete opposite, depending on various factors such as whether they are created by a state or a private company.</p>
