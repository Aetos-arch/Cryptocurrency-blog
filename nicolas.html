			<div>
				<p>The creation of virtual currency in 2009 has greatly impacted investors and people's lives. The innovation has sparked both positive and negative discussions.
					<br><br>
					The first and most important virtual currency/cryptocurrency today is Bitcoin. Created in 2009, Bitcoin is a virtual currency (digital, encrypted) whose value is determined by supply and demand. Thanks to blockchain technology (a transparent and secure database recording transactions), the traceability of exchanges is guaranteed and secure.</p>

				<p>Cryptocurrency has numerous advantages. Through it, thousands of individuals who invested dollars or euros before its inflation have become wealthy. Users living in countries where having a bank account is difficult now have an electronic cryptocurrency wallet.
					<br>
					Indeed, Bitcoin is secure and reliable. It enables encrypted and tamper-proof transactions. It is also independent and preserves the anonymity of its users. However, we should not overlook its risks.
					<br><br>
					Due to its anonymity, cryptocurrency provides a solution for criminal activities and tax evasion.
					<br>
					Moreover, Bitcoin experiences significant fluctuations, making it a risky investment that can cause financial losses to its users due to its extremely volatile value.
					<br>
					Additionally, to store cryptocurrency, a digital safe is required. If a bankruptcy or hacking occurs, the deposit is not guaranteed. This currency is very lightly regulated by legislation.
