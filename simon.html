				<p>According to BFMTV, "cryptocurrencies are digital currencies, secure and supposedly decentralized. Their value theoretically does not depend on any bank or government." Each cryptocurrency follows different rules, let's mention Bitcoin, its value increases based on supply and demand.
					<br><br>
					Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, has a project for a cryptocurrency called Libra. On October 23, the CEO tried to defend his project before the congressional financial services committee in Washington, but had difficulty doing so, which worries the states.</p>

				<p>Another opponent of the project is the EU, according to Le Figaro, French Minister of Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire stated that they do not want "digital giants to increasingly extend their influence into new fields.
					<br>
					We do not see what legitimizes the entry of digital giants into a field of competence that belongs to the states."
					<br><br>
					Another cryptocurrency will be launched, the "crypto-yuan" by China, it will not be decentralized unlike other cryptocurrencies, its goal is to replace cash with digital currency, it will be "controlled" by the People's Bank of China which wants to maintain "a balance between 'controllable anonymity' and the fight against money laundering, financing of criminal activities" according to Cryptonaute.
					<br><br>
					But the biggest problem with cryptocurrency is hacking, Americans have been victims of cryptocurrency theft through SIM-swap (which involves diverting a phone number to usurp the owner's identity), or the company BitPoint Japan which lost 29 million euros of cryptocurrencies, according to BFMTV "the Japanese financial services regulator had decided to impose greater control over cryptocurrency exchange operations" in 2014 following a major hack but it did not work.</p>
