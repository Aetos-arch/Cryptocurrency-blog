		<h2 class="center">Introduction</h2>

		<p>Cryptocurrency is a major innovation created in 2009 that has generated significant economic, sociological, and political discussion. Cryptocurrency is a secure, decentralized, and anonymous virtual currency. This raises the question: to what extent has the evolution of cryptocurrency impacted and could it continue to impact people's lives?</p>

		<h2 class="center">A More Digital Economy</h2>

		<p>Cryptocurrency represents a shift towards a more digital economy. In the third quarter of 2019, for example, 42 million people used a Bitcoin wallet on the Blockchain, and by May 2019, there were 4,735 Bitcoin ATMs worldwide. As it gains more prominence and allows other economic actors to benefit from it, such as Facebook and China, it demonstrates the democratization of cryptocurrency. However, its impact on security, due to its anonymity, can be seen as a solution for criminal activities.</p>

		<h2 class="center">Disadvantages</h2>
		<p>One of the biggest problems with cryptocurrency is hacking, as demonstrated by the case of the main Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange in 2014, where 850,000 bitcoins vanished, equivalent to 425 million euros. Furthermore, while anonymity may be perceived as an advantage for its users, virtual currency favors criminal activities, which can impact both individuals and states. Therefore, states have taken measures against the challenges and risks of cryptocurrency and will continue to take more as it becomes more significant.
			<br><br>
			Major players such as China and Facebook have developed their own virtual currencies. This development can be concerning as it may disrupt the international monetary system. Cryptocurrency is currently at the center of debates, especially in Europe where states want to enter the virtual currency market. This indicates that states are involved in this economic evolution, and virtual currency will have political repercussions. In the future, we can imagine a greater level of government regulation to address certain dangers it poses, despite its various advantages for users and investors.</p>

		<h2 class="center">Opportunities</h2>
		<p>Cryptocurrency offers a level of security and reliability that traditional currency lacks. It enables encrypted and tamper-proof transactions. Additionally, it is independent, preserves anonymity, resolves trust issues with banks, promotes transparency, protects individual rights and freedoms, makes payment more accessible, and aims for global consensus. However, these advantages have also created security and economic disadvantages. As we have seen, its potential is limited, and its impact on the environment and the bankruptcy of investors and users due to Bitcoin's volatility could be disastrous.</p>

		<h2 class="center">Conclusion</h2>
		<p>The evolution of cryptocurrency has already impacted and could further impact people's lives, as this currency has the power to influence our environment both positively and negatively. In the future, cryptocurrency could become more widespread, but its disadvantages should be resolved or limited by major stakeholders so that a majority of disadvantages does not outweigh a minority of advantages.</p>
